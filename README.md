# Mars Landing
I wrote this code as part of a final project for one of my courses. In it, I used MATLAB to model several trajectories of a capsule landing on Mars. While some supporting files, viz. `thruster.m`, `air_density.m`, and `drag_parameters.m`, were provided by the professor, I was directly responsible for `trajectory.m`, `read_input.m`, and `project.m` (the latter I renamed as `main.m` to more clearly indicate the main project script).

For more information about the project, including the physical assumptions made to simplify the calculations, please see the file `project_description.pdf`.

Note: I received permission from the course professor to post this code.
